	annote = {A new pixel detector for the CMS experiment was built in   order to cope with the instantaneous luminosities anticipated for   the Phase I Upgrade of the LHC .  The new CMS pixel detector   provides four-hit tracking with a reduced material budget as well as   new cooling and powering schemes.  A new front-end readout chip   mitigates buffering and bandwidth limitations, and allows operation   at low comparator thresholds.  In this paper, comprehensive test   beam studies are presented, which have been conducted to verify the   design and to quantify the performance of the new detector   assemblies in terms of tracking efficiency and spatial resolution.   Under optimal conditions, the tracking efficiency is    99.95 ± 0.05%, while the intrinsic spatial resolutions   are 4.80 ± 0.25 μm and 7.99 ± 0.21 μm along the 100 μm and 150 μm pixel pitch, respectively.  The findings are   compared to a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the pixel detector   and good agreement is found.}

      abstract     = {The International Linear Collider Technical Design Report
                      (TDR) describes in four volumes the physics case and the
                      design of a 500 GeV centre-of-mass energy linear
                      electron-positron collider based on superconducting
                      radio-frequency technology using Niobium cavities as the
                      accelerating structures. The accelerator can be extended to
                      1 TeV and also run as a Higgs factory at around 250 GeV and
                      on the Z0 pole. A comprehensive value estimate of the
                      accelerator is give, together with associated uncertainties.
                      It is shown that no significant technical issues remain to
                      be solved. Once a site is selected and the necessary
                      site-dependent engineering is carried out, construction can
                      begin immediately. The TDR also gives baseline documentation
                      for two high-performance detectors that can share the ILC
                      luminosity by being moved into and out of the beam line in a
                      'push-pull' configuration. These detectors, ILD and SiD, are
                      described in detail. They form the basis for a world-class
                      experimental programme that promises to increase
                      significantly our understanding of the fundamental processes
                      that govern the evolution of the Universe.},
