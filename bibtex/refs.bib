	annote = {A new pixel detector for the CMS experiment was built in   order to cope with the instantaneous luminosities anticipated for   the Phase I Upgrade of the LHC .  The new CMS pixel detector   provides four-hit tracking with a reduced material budget as well as   new cooling and powering schemes.  A new front-end readout chip   mitigates buffering and bandwidth limitations, and allows operation   at low comparator thresholds.  In this paper, comprehensive test   beam studies are presented, which have been conducted to verify the   design and to quantify the performance of the new detector   assemblies in terms of tracking efficiency and spatial resolution.   Under optimal conditions, the tracking efficiency is    99.95 ± 0.05%, while the intrinsic spatial resolutions   are 4.80 ± 0.25 μm and 7.99 ± 0.21 μm along the 100 μm and 150 μm pixel pitch, respectively.  The findings are   compared to a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the pixel detector   and good agreement is found.}
