\abstract{
We present the concept of a new type of silicon tracking sensor called Enhanced Lateral Drift (ELAD) sensor. 
In ELAD sensors the spatial resolution of the impact position of ionising particles is improved by a dedicated charge sharing mechanism,
 which is achieved by a non-homogeneous electric field in the lateral direction in the sensor bulk. 
The non-homogeneous electric field is created by doping implants with a higher concentration with respect to the background concentration of the bulk. 
A position-dependent charge sharing allows for an improved interpolation of the impact position. 

TCAD-based electric field simulations for 2D and 3D geometries as well as transient simulations with a traversing particle for the 2D geometry have been carried out.
The electric field profiles have further been optimised for position resolution.
The simulations show a strong dependence of the charge sharing mechanism on the buried implant concentration.
Optimal values for the buried implant concentration allow for nearly linear charge sharing between two readout electrodes as a function of the impact position.
Additionally, the foreseen production technique combining silicon epitaxy and ion beam implantation is outlined.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%FIXME add reference for ILC cdr and clic yellow report
Experiments at possible future colliders like CLIC\footnote{Compact Linear Collider}~\cite{cdr} and ILC\footnote{International Linear Collider}~\cite{ILCcdr} aim, among others,
 for a precise measurement of Higgs decays to pairs of b-quarks, c-quarks and gluons and efficient identification of top quarks in the decay t$\mathrm{\rightarrow}$Wb.
To this end, the experiments require light-weight detectors with a single-point resolution of a few micrometers. 
%The CLIC project assumes a linear $\mathrm{e^+/e^-}$ accelerator with a center-of-mass energy up to 3~TeV and a luminosity of 2$\mathrm{\cdot10^{34}~cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$~\cite{cdr}.
E.g., the tracker and vertex detectors for CLIC require a single point resolution of better than 7~$\muup$m and 3~$\muup$m, respectively, in the transverse plane
 to meet the requirements on the track-momentum and impact parameter resolution at a total silicon detector thickness of less than 100~$\muup$m~\cite{det}.
Several options for tracking and vertex sensor technology are considered for CLIC, among them are monolithic and hybrid detectors~\cite{yellowreport}.

This work focuses on a new type of a hybrid detector aiming to meet the requirements of the CLIC vertex detector.
A common approach to achieve an improved position resolution in silicon detectors is to decrease the readout cell size.
This leads to an increased number of readout channels and less area for logic per channel on the readout chip.
Additionally, the miniturisation of interconnection techniques might present limits. 

The position resolution can also be improved by means of charge sharing, i.e.\ by collecting the charge on more than one readout electrode.
Geometric charge sharing is used e.g.\ in the CMS experiment by tilting the sensors in the Endcap~\cite{simon}. 
Lorentz drift induced charge sharing by means of a magnetic field is realised in the barrel section of the experiment~\cite{cmstdr}.
However, these two methods do not provide sufficient charge sharing in thin ($\leq 100\,\muup$m) sensors~\cite{yellowreport},
 as either unrealistically strong magnetic fields or huge sensor tilts would be necessary, the latter in turn increasing the material budget.

The hybrid detector proposed herein, a so-called Enhanced Lateral Drift (ELAD) sensor in combination with a readout ASIC,
 introduces a lateral electric field component in the sensor bulk yielding a lateral charge drift to achieve a position resolution of a few micrometre. 
This lateral component of the electric field is created by regions deep within the sensor bulk featuring a higher doping concentration with respect to the background doping concentration.
This diminishes the need to downsize the sensor pitch while avoiding sensor tilt or magnetic fields. 

In Sec.~\ref{sec:con}, we detail the concept of the ELAD sensor.
The SYNOPSYS TCAD simulations and the analysis of charge collection distribution on neighbouring readout electrodes are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:sim}.
Finally, the production technique is outlined in Sec.~\ref{sec:pr}. 


\section{Concept of the ELAD sensor}
\label{sec:con}
Charged particles traversing a silicon sensor create free electron-hole pairs, which drift inside the sensor following the electric field lines.
Due to insufficient diffusion in thin, depleted, standard planar sensors the created charge is collected almost entirely by the nearest electrode and only a small fraction of it by the neighbouring electrode.
Therefore, in this particular case, an improved position resolution is achieved only by downsizing the distance between strips/pixels, i.e. the pitch size.

The concept of the ELAD sensor relies on a dedicated charge sharing mechanism independent of sensor tilt and magnetic fields by means of local modifications to the electric field,
 yielding a position-dependent charge collection by two electrodes~\cite{hj}.
To this end the electric field profile is altered by implants with higher doping concentration with respect to the background doping concentration of the bulk. 
This changes the electric field lines in such a way that the charge carriers move towards the centre between two electrodes, and might diffuse into the next unit cell, leading to a partial collection at both electrodes.
An optimal position resolution is achieved if the distribution of the collected charge between two electrodes is a linear function of the particle's impact position, 
 i.e.\ the entirety of the charge is collected at one electrode if the impact position is in the centre of the readout electrode,
 the charge is equally shared between two electrodes if the impact position is half-way between two electrodes
 and in between the shared fraction of the charge increases linearly with the distance to the electrode's centre.
Our realisation of an ELAD sensor contains two types of buried implants: p-implants and n-implants, effectively reducing the impact of the additional stationary charges on $N\mathrm{_{eff}}$~\cite{elad}. 
With such a balancing of p- and n-implants, a similar depletion voltage as in a standard planar sensor with an epitaxial layer of the same background concentration and thickness is achieved.
The utilisation of two types of buried implants also creates a stronger electric field in the lateral direction, thereby improving the charge-sharing behaviour.
The buried implants are arranged in layers forming a trapezoidal area in which the drift is altered.

\section{TCAD simulations}
\label{sec:sim}

Two types of ELAD sensors have been designed -- p-in-n (n-ELAD) and n-in-p (p-ELAD~\cite{elad}) sensors.
The n-ELAD sensor is formed by an n-type substrate in combination with three n-type epitaxial layers (resulting from the production process),
 three interjacent buried implant layers, each containing one buried p-implant with its centre in the middle between two readout implants and two adjacent n-implants,
 p-type readout implants and a backplane implant.
The design of the n-ELAD sensor is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:geom}, where RO$_{\textrm{left}}$ and RO$_{\textrm{right}}$ denote the two relevant readout electrodes within one unit cell.
Orange (blue) areas represent buried n-implants (p-implants), with a light-green (dark-green) colour showing the epitaxial zone (wafer) of the sensor. 
The distance from the top of the sensor to the first buried implant layer is 10\,$\muup$m, the distance between buried implant layers is 10\,$\muup$m, the total thickness of the epitaxial layer amounts to 30\,$\muup$m.
Analogously, the p-ELAD sensor is formed by a p-type substrate and three p-type epitaxial layers,
 with three buried implant layers with an inverted doping in each layer with respect to the n-ELAD,
 n-type readout implants, a moderated p-spray isolation and a backplane implant.
The pitch for both types of the ELAD is 55\,$\muup$m in order to match the TimePix3 readout chip footprint~\cite{tp3}; the readout implant size amounts initially to 20\,$\muup$m.

The Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) framework by SYNOPSYS is used for the simulation presented herein~\cite{syn}.
Two types of simulations have been performed: electric field simulations and transient simulations with a MIP traversing the sensor.
Simulations of the electric field have been performed to describe the behaviour of the ELAD sensors in 2D and 3D.
In order to study the performance of ELAD sensors, transient simulations of 2D geometries have been executed for n-type and p-type ELAD sensors.
This allows for the analysis of the distribution of the collected charge on neighbouring readout electrodes as a function of the impact position, also known as $\etaup$-function.
The parameters which have been optimised to approach a linear behaviour of the $\etaup$-function are: the depth of the first buried implant layer w.r.t.\ sensor surface, the distance between buried implant layers,
 the readout implant size, the bias voltage and the doping concentration of the buried implants. 
The electric field profile yielding an optimal charge sharing behaviour is obtained via a scan over the specified parameters.
Here, we detail the optimisation process with respect to the buried implant concentration and the readout implant size.


\subsection{Electric field}
\label{sec:ef}
The electric field simulations are performed in a quasi-stationary mode, in which the voltage is applied to the electrodes of a device.
The voltage is ramped incrementally to a target value; in each step the electric field profile is calculated
 by solving the Poisson's equation with the charge density from the previous iteration as starting value.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:el} the total electric field with its electric field lines is presented for a) a standard, planar n-type sensor and b) the n-ELAD sensor
 with a total thickness of 150~$\muup$m and a thickness of the epitaxial layer of 30~$\muup$m.
The electric field lines in the standard planar n-type sensor lead directly to the readout electrodes. 
In the n-ELAD sensor, the electric field lines change their behaviour with respect to the standard planar sensor, effectively pointing to the centre between two readout electrodes. 
Hence, the buried implants create a lateral electric field component the bulk of the sensor rendering a position-dependent charge sharing possible.

 and b) - e) the n-ELAD sensor with different buried implant concentrations

Red (blue) areas indicate a hole drift component to the right (left).
%While drifting close to the unit cell boundary the holes have a sufficiently high probability of diffusing into the next unit cell.
%Hence, holes are collected by two electrodes.
Equivalently in the case of the p-ELAD sensors, the electron drift paths are influenced by the buried implants.

The buried implants create a defined electric field in the lateral direction. 
With increasing doping concentration of the buried implants the lateral electric field becomes stronger and its effect on the drift paths of the charge carriers larger.
The electric field in the longitudinal direction is created by the applied voltage. 
The ratio between the longitudinal and lateral components of the electric field changes with the applied voltage and buried implant concentrations.
Identification of the optimal operational voltage allows an effective usage of the ELAD sensor.

\end{figure}

3D electric fields simulations with strip and pixel readouts have been carried out to verify 2D electric field simulations.
The result of the 3D simulation for the strip readout is shown in~Fig.~\ref{fig:3d}.
In order to optimise the duration of the simulation process a quarter of the unit cell has been modelled exploiting the symmetry of the design.
The cross section of the 3D electric field profile resembles the one obtained from the 2D simulations, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ef}~(d). 



\subsection{Transients}
\label{sec:tr}
In transient simulations the response of the device to a traversing particle is simulated. 
The transient simulation approximates a continuous process as a sequence of frames with a short time difference. 
In each frame and for each mesh node the Poisson's equation and carrier continuity equations are solved for electrons and holes.
A four-unit-cells geometry has been used with the region of interest extending from the centre of the second readout implant towards the rightwards next unit cell boundary.  
MIP incident positions have been simulated at 0\,$\muup$m (centre of \textit{left} readout implant), 6.3\,$\muup$m, 11.6\,$\muup$m, 16.9\,$\muup$m, 22.2\,$\muup$m and 27.5\,$\muup$m (unit cell boundary).

}
  \label{fig:tr}
\end{figure}


In Fig.~\ref{fig:tr} the hole current density in the n-ELAD sensor with $n\mathrm{_{di}}$~=~2.8$\mathrm{\cdot10^{15}\,cm^{-3}}$ for four time steps is shown.
In the first two time steps (Fig.~\ref{fig:tr}~a), b)) the charge carriers created above the buried implants are collected by the nearest, i.e.\ the left electrode.
Charges created beneath the buried implants change their drift path and move towards the centre (Fig.~\ref{fig:tr}~c), d)) reducing the required diffusion to cross the cell boundary
 and thereby enabling for charge sharing.
Congruent results have been obtained for the p-ELAD sensor.
For comparison, Fig.~\ref{fig:tr}~e) shows a standard planar sensor at $t~=~2.0\,$ns with the MIP traversing at the same position and no charge sharing can be observed.
In the following part, we exemplify the optimisation process for two of the ELAD parameters at the example of the buried layer concentration and the readout implant size. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:eta} the collected charge from two neighbouring readout electrodes as a function of the six different MIP positions ($\etaup$-function) is presented.
The response of the n-ELAD and the p-ELAD sensor with different buried implant concentrations are indicated as
 circles (triangles) showing the collected charge from the left (right) strip
 and as crosses corresponding to the sum of the collected charges. 
For comparison, a sensor with an epitaxial layer but without buried implants (\textit{empty} ELAD) is added. 
The trend of the $\etaup$-functions depends on the buried implant concentration.
In the case of the n-ELAD (Fig.~\ref{fig:eta}~a)) the lowest simulated buried implant concentration of 2.0$\mathrm{\cdot10^{15}\,cm^{-3}}$ (black~line) does not yield an optimal $\etaup$-function,
 however, the effect of the buried implants is already noticeable w.r.t.\ the empty ELAD. 
The blue line shows the result for the highest buried implant concentration of 3.0$\mathrm{\cdot10^{15}\,cm^{-3}}$. 
In this case, the buried implants create an electric field in the lateral direction that is too strong, and the effect of the charge sharing is stronger than at the optimum.
For an applied voltage of 280\,V the optimal buried implant concentration is 2.8$\mathrm{\cdot10^{15}\,cm^{-3}}$ approaching the linear behaviour closest for the concentrations under study.
For the p-ELAD sensor and an applied voltage of 300\,V (see Fig.~\ref{fig:eta}~b)) the optimal buried implant concentration amounts to 2.4$\mathrm{\cdot10^{15}\,cm^{-3}}$.
Hence, for a given concentration the operational voltage should be carefully chosen to yield an optimal ratio between the electric field strength in the longitudinal and the lateral direction. 
If the applied voltage is too low (too high) the effect of the charge sharing by the buried implants is too strong (too weak) resulting in a considerable deviation of the $\etaup$-function from the linear case.

\end{figure}

To study the effect of the readout implant size on the $\etaup$-function several readout implant sizes have been simulated at $n\mathrm{_{di}}$~=~3.0$\mathrm{\cdot10^{15}\,cm^{-3}}$. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:rosize} the transient simulation results for a) the n-ELAD and b) the p-ELAD sensor are shown.
The simulated readout implant sizes are 20\,$\muup$m (black continuous lines), 26\,$\muup$m, 30\,$\muup$m and 40\,$\muup$m (blue lines).
The buried implant concentration in the n-ELAD and p-ELAD sensors is $\mathrm{n_{di}}$~=~3$\mathrm{\cdot10^{15}\,cm^{-3}}$ and the bias voltage is 275\,V and 300\,V, respectively. 
The black dashed lines show the n-ELAD and p-ELAD sensors with the zero buried implant concentration and readout implant size of 20\,$\muup$m, corresponding to empty ELAD sensors.
For both the n-ELAD and the p-ELAD sensors the size of the readout implant impacts the shape of the $\etaup$-function.
At the largest studied readout implant size of 40\,$\muup$m, the charge sharing effect is weakest.
With increasing size of the readout implant the effect of the charge sharing decreases.  
Thus, the size of the readout cell is another parameter for tuning the shape of the $\etaup$-function in ELAD sensors.

\section{ELAD production technique}
\label{sec:pr}
The realisation of the ELAD sensors requires a new production process combining several repetitive steps.
Each step includes an ion beam surface implantation and epitaxial growth using the CVD\footnote{Chemical Vapor Deposition} method. 

The first step of production is a surface ion implantation of the first layer of buried implants on a silicon wafer.
On the top of the implanted silicon, an epitaxial layer is grown.
The process is repeated three times. 
Finally, after the last epitaxial growth, common processes used for standard planar sensors are applied e.g.\ edging and preparation of readout implants.

As the CVD process imposes a large temperature budget on the implants, the process simulations have been executed in order to quantify a possible effect on the ELAD sensors performance. 
The results of the process simulations on a buried Boron implant after three 20\,min temperature cycles show a change in the size of the buried implant in a range less than 1\,$\muup$m.
The electric field and transient simulations have been validated according to this change in size, and show no effect on the $\etaup$-function performance.


\section{Conclusions}
Development of the ELAD sensor is a new technologically-challenging project in silicon vertex sensors for high energy physics. 
In the ELAD sensors, a dedicated charge sharing mechanism is used in order to improve the position resolution without using a magnetic field or sensor tilt.
The charge-sharing effect is achieved by changing the path of the charge carriers in the lateral direction in the bulk of the sensor.
The well-tuned buried implant structure creates a non-homogeneous electric field.
Two types of sensors, n-ELAD and p-ELAD sensors, have been presented.
The electric-field simulations for the 2D and 3D geometries show the electric field in the lateral direction created by the buried implants.
The electric-field and transient simulations show the dependence of the $\etaup$-function, and hence spatial resolution, in the ELAD sensors on the buried implant concentration at a fixed pitch size.
The TCAD simulations show a nearly linear $\etaup$-function for $n\mathrm{_{di}}$~=~2.4$\mathrm{\cdot10^{15}\,cm^{-3}}$ at a bias voltage of U~=~300\,V for the p-ELAD sensor,
 demonstrating the possibility to obtain almost the theoretical optimum of charge sharing.
The electric field profiles from 2D and 3D simulations will be used as input for Monte Carlo-based position resolution studies.
Additionally, new manufacturing technique foreseen for the ELAD prototype production has been presented.
